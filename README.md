# -Personal-Diary-Application-tkinter-

How It Works:

Text Input: The tk.Text widget is used for multi-line input.

File Operations: filedialog.asksaveasfilename and filedialog.askopenfilename are used for saving and opening files. Text is written to or read from .txt files.

UI Layout: Buttons are placed in a horizontal frame for easy access. The main text area expands dynamically with the window size.

Example Usage:

Launch the app, write your diary entry, and click Save Entry. To view a saved entry, click Open Entry and select a file. Use Clear Entry to reset the text area.
